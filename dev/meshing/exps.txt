Sigma and thresh refers to the Gaussian smoothing of particle positions


Ilastik marching cubes
1: sigma=3, thresh=1/5, 4 smoothing rounds
2: sigma=3, thresh=1/8, 4 smoothing rounds
5: sigma=3, thresh=1/8, 4 smoothing rounds, edge padding

Skimage marching cubes
3. sigma=3, thresh=1/5
4. sigma=3, thresh=1/5, edge padding for closed surface
