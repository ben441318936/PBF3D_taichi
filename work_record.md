- Discussion with Fei, settled on some big directions for project
    - Build a blood suction fluid simulator first
    - Possible future extensions
        - Learning dynamics in real-time for surgical robotcs
        - Robot control such as optimal suction placement and orientation, finding source of flow, etc
- Taichi learning and experiments
    - Watched 2 Taichi lectures
    - Installed Taichi, started experimenting with it
        - Modified 2D PBD based simulation to 3D
- TODOs
    - Camera mapping: how to visualize the 3D results
    - More complex scene and evironment, instead of a retangular box
